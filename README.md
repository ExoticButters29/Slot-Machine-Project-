# Slot-Machine-Project-
The Slot Machine is a Python-based casino-style game created by a three-person team for an Intro to Computer Science course.
The project simulates a real slot machine while also including player accounts, data saving, daily bonuses, leaderboards, achievements, and progression systems such as levels and streak bonuses.

The game is entirely text-based and runs in the terminal.
